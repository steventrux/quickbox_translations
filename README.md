###How to create a template for a new language

Creating a template for a new language is fairly straight-forward. Simply copy one of the already made language templates and begin translating.

The only files you need worry about are the ones marked ``lang_``. These are the official template arrays that will then be ported over to official QuickBox Repositories.
